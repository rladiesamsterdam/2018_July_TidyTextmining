# workshop_July2018

Workshop material for the third R- Ladies Amsterdam meetup on 17th July 2018 at Accenture.


Repository includes the presentations (recap on tidyverse & tidy textmining), workshop notebook and the datasets for the workshop can be downloaded from here: https://goo.gl/fUP1Uf for the tidy text mining workshop by Eline Tjeng and Laury van Bedaf. 


Note: due to some issues with the `feather` package, all datasets that are loaded in through the notebook as a feather file, should now be loaded as a .csv file.
